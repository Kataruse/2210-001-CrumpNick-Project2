# Project2 SortingAlgorithms

## Description
This project is designed to be an exploration of sorting algorithms. Students are to determine
the effectiveness of different sorting algorithms depending on the data being sorted. Variables
of concern are the number of elements to sort, reference type vs value type, and O(n2) vs
O(Lg(n)) algorithmic runtimes. Additionally, students must demonstrate their ability to
experiment with data, collaborate with others, and present their findings.

## How to install
Download the most recent version and extract to file name.

## How to use
Double click the "SortingAlgorithms.sln" file to open up the project in Microsoft Visual Studio, then press the green arrow run button with the text "SortingAlgorithms" following it to run the algorithm tests.

## FAQ

### Are Averages Generated Automatically as Well?
No, we manually added them to the .csv located in the project and have no intentions on adding that feature currently.
